fragroute
---------

fragroute intercepts, modifies, and rewrites egress traffic destined
for a specified host, implementing most of the attacks described in
the Secure Networks "Insertion, Evasion, and Denial of Service:
Eluding Network Intrusion Detection" paper of January 1998.

required libraries / drivers:

libdnet:	http://libdnet.sourceforge.net/
libpcap:	http://www.tcpdump.org/
libevent:	http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/ (for non-Win2k only)
TUN/TAP:	http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/  (for Solaris only)
CIPE-win32:	http://cipe-win32.sourceforge.net/ (for Win2k only)

built and tested on OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, and Windows 2000. YMMV.

NOTE: TCP-based attacks do not work on Windows 2000, which resets
asymmetrically-routed TCP connections. any ideas? :-/
